# MERN Stack Learning and Practice ðŸš€

Welcome to my **MERN Stack Learning and Practice** repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn, build, and improve my skills in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

## ðŸŒŸ About the Repository  

This repository serves as:
- A **record** of my progress while learning the MERN stack.
- A collection of **projects** and practice exercises that Iâ€™ve built during my learning journey.
- A **reference** for concepts, challenges, and solutions I encountered while working with the stack.
